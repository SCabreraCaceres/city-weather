# Getting Started

This application retrieves the weather information of a given city from an open source at 
[https://openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/current).
It runs on Java 11 and Maven 3.6.3.

Intellij: To run **My city weather** you can use a Spring Boot run configuration or simply click on the run button
in class MyCityWeatherApplication.java.

To run it from a terminal you can use `mvn spring-boot:run`.

The entry endpoint is a GET localhost:8080/v1/weather/city/[yourcityname] that you can call from Postman, Talend API or
using a curl from a terminal. Also running this test MyCityWeatherApplicationTestIT you can see the output from 
the endpoint in the console.

# Backend Developer Test Assignment

## Goal
The goal of this test assignment is to write a Spring Boot application in Java which returns the current weather information for a city using the OpenWeather API.

## OpenWeather API
Please use the current open weather API https://openweathermap.org/current
with the following API_KEY: c2395dafd752b24690e1cdd50b5a6972

## Requirements
- Please create a compilable Spring Boot application using maven or gradle.
- Please spend no more than 3 hours on the task. Incomplete solutions are also welcomed.

### Task - Weather API
Please create a Web Application which should:
- Accept a city name via REST API
- Get the current weather for the city name using the OpenWeather API
- Return the response as JSON following this **[JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)**:
```
{
  "title": "Weather",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "condition": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The description of the weather. eg: scattered clouds."
    },
    "temperature": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "The actual temperature of the city in celsius."
    },
    "wind_speed": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Speed of the wind in km/h.",
      "minimum": 0
    }
  }
}
```
- Please write tests or describe the testing approach you would do
- Validate the input of the REST API allow only meaningful data and handle invalid requests.

### Bonus Task
- Create an OpenAPI Specification with Swagger
- Optimize the performance e.g.: introducing cache

## Guidelines
Implement the solution you think is the best:
- follow REST API guidelines
- follow clean code practices
- rely on Spring Boot and it's dependency management

## Share your solution
Please create a Pull Request when you are ready, so we can review it.

**Have fun with the exercise üèÉ and again don't worry if you don't finish everything, our main intention
is to see how you work and to talk to you about the ideas and concepts üìö you followed.**
